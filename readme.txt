# Project Workflow Guide

## Overview

This document will guide you through the process of how we work on tasks in this project. We will follow a simple and structured approach to ensure our work is organized and easily trackable. Below is the step-by-step approach that you should follow:

## Steps to Follow:

### 1. **Stub Out the Code**

   Start by creating a basic structure or “stub” for the code. This means setting up the initial code without worrying about the complete implementation. Just get the basic functions, classes, or modules in place.

### 2. **Add Code to a Markdown File**

   After stubbing out the code, copy the code into a Markdown file. This helps in documenting what you’ve done so far. The Markdown file should include:
   - A clear description of what the code is doing.
   - Any setup or instructions necessary for running the code.
   - The structure of your code (such as functions or classes).

### 3. **Upload the Markdown File to "Projects"**

   Once the stub code is added to the Markdown file, upload it to the designated location in the “Projects” folder or repository. This step ensures that everyone has access to the initial code and can track progress.

### 4. **Continue with Remaining Tasks**

   After uploading the stub code, continue working on the remaining tasks. This could include:
   - Completing the code implementation.
   - Writing tests.
   - Debugging any issues.

### 5. **Update the Markdown File**

   As you make progress with the code, update the Markdown file. Include the new changes, explain what has been implemented, and document any important updates or decisions.

### 6. **Replace the Old File with the Updated Markdown File**

   Once you’ve made significant updates to the code and the Markdown file, replace the previously uploaded Markdown file in the “Projects” folder with the new version. This keeps everyone updated with the latest progress.

## Example Workflow:

1. **Stub Out Code**: Write the basic structure of your code.
2. **Add to Markdown**: Document the stub code in a Markdown file.
3. **Upload to "Projects"**: Upload the Markdown file to the “Projects” folder.
4. **Work on Remaining Tasks**: Implement the full functionality.
5. **Update Markdown**: Update the file with new changes and details.
6. **Replace Old File**: Upload the updated file to replace the previous version.
